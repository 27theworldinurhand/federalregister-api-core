<h1 id="about">About FederalRegister.gov</h1>

<p>The Office of the Federal Register (OFR) of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), and the U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO) jointly administer the FederalRegister.gov website.  The OFR/GPO partnership is developing an unofficial prototype of an XML-based edition of the daily Federal Register on this site.  In the prototype edition, Federal Register documents are organized and displayed in an easier to read format; we have also added various web tools and user aids designed to help people find material relevant to their interests.  We built this XML edition of the Federal Register to make it easier for citizens and communities to understand the regulatory process and to participate in Government decision-making.</p>

<p>You can now find the Federal Register electronic public inspection desk at www.OFR.gov.</p>

<p>See the “Legal Status” page of this website for more information on the unofficial status of this XML prototype of the Federal Register, and the process for granting it official legal status under the authority of the Administrative Committee of the Federal Register. </p>

<h1 id="mission">Mission, Authority, and Vision for Public Participation</h1>

<h2>Mission</h2> 
<p>The Office of the Federal Register informs citizens of their rights and obligations, documents the actions of Federal agencies, and provides a forum for public participation in the democratic process.  Our publications provide access to a wide range of Federal benefits and opportunities for funding and contain comprehensive information about the various activities of the United States Government.  In addition, we administer the Electoral College for Presidential elections and the Constitutional amendment process.</p>

<p>The Federal Register is updated daily by 6 a.m. and is published Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays, and consists of four types of entries.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Presidential Documents, including Executive orders and proclamations.</li>
  <li>Rules and Regulations, including policy statements and interpretations of rules.</li>
  <li>Proposed Rules, including petitions for rulemaking and other advance proposals.</li>
  <li>Notices, including scheduled hearings and meetings open to the public, grant applications, administrative orders, and other announcements of government actions.</li>
</ul>

<p>We recommend reading the “Learn” pages of this site for more on the structure and value of the Federal Register and for an overview of the regulatory process.</p>


<h2>Authority</h2>

<p>The Office of the Federal Register was created in 1935 under the Federal Register Act (44 U.S.C. 1501, et seq.) and its mission was enlarged by the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.) and the Freedom of Information Act of 1966 (5 U.S.C. 552 and 553).  Federal Register regulations are published in 1 CFR chapters I and II.  </p>


<h2>Public Participation</h2>

<p>Our goal in converting print-based material to machine-readable XML data is to make the Federal Register more searchable, more accessible, easier to digest, and easier to share with people and information systems.   As we build a more user-friendly version of the Federal Register, the OFR and GPO encourage every citizen to become more involved in the workings of their government and to make their voices heard on the things that matter to them, from the smallest to the largest issues.</p>
