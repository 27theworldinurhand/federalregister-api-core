  <p>
    Executive Orders are official documents, numbered consecutively, through which the President of the United States manages the operations of the Federal Government.
    The text of Executive Orders appears in the daily Federal Register as each Executive Order is signed by the President and received by the Office of the Federal Register.
  </p>

  <p>Executive Orders made since 1994 are available as a single bulk download and as a bulk download by president, or you can browse by president and year below.</p>
